Robot Study Circle known as RSC, the Prestigious Robotics Club of COEP is one of the best Robotics clubs in India. It’s a totally different world where club members have created hundreds of robots for society such as Drones, Railway Track Surveillance Robot, Bomb Disposal Robots, and Badminton Playing Robots etc. Robot Study Circle is the National Champion in ROBOCON which is one of the best competitions in robotics in the world. RSC represented India in International Robocon held at Tokyo, Japan and won 6th international position as well as Nagase Award for the country. Also, the Club has industrial collaboration with Siemens PLM as a title sponsor, Volkswagen, Janatics Pneumatics, Schmalz India, Pepperl & Fuchs, and Robolab Technologies. Members of Robot Study Circle are members of the first ever institute student chapter of THE ROBOTICS SOCIETY established in India at College of Engineering, Pune
