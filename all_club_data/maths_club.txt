Though, Mathematics is the language of all science subjects and the backbone of Engineering subjects also, one can enjoy the beauty of Mathematics in its pure form also.

Ramanujan Mathematics Club was founded to encourage students to get acquainted with the various branches of Mathematics like Abstract Algebra, Analysis, Discrete Mathematics and to motivate them to study mathematics used in new/emerging technologies.

 

Every year Ramanujan Mathematics Club arranges lectures on interesting topics by eminent personalities in the field(both academia and industry) and organizes weekly/monthly quizzes.
