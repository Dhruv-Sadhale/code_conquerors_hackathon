A long way through the window into the night sky, where not only the journey is alluring, but so is the destination. Yes, it's the universe; with all it holds, it's calling for us. And who wouldn't want to explore? 

Since its foundation in 2004, the COEP Astronomy Club has sought to build on this fascination. It brings innovation and passion to its vision of spreading the awareness and knowledge of astronomy and space sciences to the students. 

 

The COEP Astronomy Club, an ambitious team driven by amateur astronomers, has managed to conjure up a lot of interest amongst the masses in the science and principles of astronomy. 

We firmly believe "Astronomy is for Everyone". 

 

Integrating technical skills with astronomical science, the club has initiated many projects, including the construction of a telescope built from scratch, we also have a functioning Horn Antenna Project, and a Gravity Simulator Web App.

  

The club strives to quench a student's thirst for astronomy by organizing various exciting events such as Star Party (a fun-filled night of star-gazing), Quiztronomy (a quiz to test people's knowledge on everything seen beyond the night sky), Telescope building and handling sessions (telescope – every astronomer's weapon) etc. 

We also conduct events like 'Torquest' (a challenging astronomy-related quiz) as well as 'Takeoff' (a fun rocket launching competition) both of which are held under 'MindSpark'. 

Public outreach sessions for underprivileged children and school children to introduce them to the basics of Astronomy are also conducted. 

  

Sharing knowledge through different modalities, the club introduces Astronomia, the site (https://coepastroclub.wordpress.com/author/coepastroclub/) where we regularly publish blogs, with 50+ blogs on various interesting topics, from space laws to a guide on pulling the Earth. Abstract, a solely research-oriented segment. Astroesque, a monthly segment to explore the world of astrophotography, is a platform for professionals and amateurs to interact and learn, Astronomy Up-to-date, a monthly segment where we look at news from all over the world in the astronomy-sphere. The club has its own social media handles on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/coepastronomyclub/), Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/coep_astronomy_club/?hl=en) and LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/68491214/admin/feed/posts/) where one can find a lot of engaging astronomy related content.

 

The club has designed a marvellous astronomical calendar (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHoQ1rbH4B4PON6oPEgcIb9wHHirFbOe/view) to witness the stellar moments appearing during the year. 

Discussions and brainstorming sessions are held weekly, wherein members explore the cosmos. 

Join us as we explore. After all, the sky is just the lower limit!
